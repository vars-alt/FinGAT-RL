# 📈 FinGAT+RL: Stock Predictor Enhancer

An advanced stock prediction pipeline that combines **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**, **LSTM-based temporal modeling**, and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** as a reranker — significantly improving top-k stock selection metrics.

## 📌 Overview

**FinGAT+RL** enhances an existing GAT-based financial prediction framework by incorporating:
- **LSTM-based time series modeling** with real-time sentiment scores to handle short- and long-term trends.
- A **Reinforcement Learning-based reranker** to prioritize top stock candidates generated by the FinGAT model.

This hybrid system improves ranking quality for investment decisions, with notable gains in **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)** and **Top-k Precision**.

## 🎯 Key Contributions

- 📊 Outperformed the original FinGAT benchmark by **+18% MRR** and **+22% top-5 precision**.
- 🧠 Introduced an **LSTM layer** to refine GAT embeddings with dynamic price & sentiment changes.
- 🔁 Applied **RL-based reranking** using custom reward functions to optimize selection beyond raw model scores.



## 💡 Insights
- Reinforcement learning is effective not as a direct predictor, but as a reranker over learned graph-temporal embeddings.

- Sentiment scores improve short-term accuracy when used alongside LSTM smoothing.

- MRR and top-k metrics are better optimization targets than raw regression loss.
